<h1>Medicare Supplement Plans</h1>
<h2>Also known as MEDIGAP Plans</h2>
<h3><em>Key Offerings and Coverage</em></h3>

    <h2 align="center">
<p>
Medigap plans are standardized by the government and sold by private insurers to cover specific cost gaps:
</p> 
<p>
<u>Medicare Part A Coinsurance and Hospital Costs:</u> Covers up to 365 extra days after Medicare benefits are used.
</p>
<p>
<u>Medicare Part B Coinsurance or Copayment:</u> Covers the 20% coinsurance for doctor bills and services.
</p>
<p>
<u>Blood Coverage:</u> Covers the first 3 pints of blood.
</p>
<p>
<u>Hospice Care Coinsurance:</u> Covers Part A hospice costs.
</p>
<p>
<u>Skilled Nursing Facility Coinsurance:</u> Covers this cost.
</p>
<p>
<u>Part A Deductible:</u> Helps pay the inpatient hospital deductible.
</p>
<p>
<u>Part B Excess Charges:</u> Covers charges if a doctor doesn't accept assignment.
</p>
<p>
<u>Foreign Travel Emergency:</u> Covers up to 80% of emergency medical care outside the U.S. (within plan limits).
</p> 
    <div align="center">
<h1><u>What Medigap Plans Do Not Cover</u></h1>
<p>
<h3><em>These plans generally do not include:</em></h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Long-term care (custodial care)</li>
  <li>Vision or Dental Coverage</li>
  <li>Hearing aids & Eyeglasses</li>
  <li>Private-duty nursing</li>
  <li>Prescription drugs (must purchase a Part D plan separately)</li>
</p>
</ul>

    <div align="center">
<h1><u>Common Plan Options</u></h1>

<p>
<u>Plan G:</u> Currently one of the most comprehensive options, covering all costs except for the Part B deductible.
</p>
<p>
<u>Plan N:</u> Covers 100% of Part B coinsurance, but requires copayments for some office and emergency room visits.
</p>
<p>
<u>High-Deductible Plans (G or F):</u> Lower monthly premiums, but you pay a high deductible before coverage kicks in. 
</p>
    <div align="center">
<h1><u>Key Considerations</u></h1>

<p>
<u>Enrollment:</u> The best time to buy is during your six-month Medigap Open Enrollment Period, when insurers cannot deny coverage or charge more due to health conditions.
</p>
<p>
<u>Network:</u> You can see any provider who accepts Medicare.
</p>
<p>
<u>Consistency:</u> Plans are standardized, meaning a Plan G from Company A has the same benefits as a Plan G from Company B, though premiums may vary.
